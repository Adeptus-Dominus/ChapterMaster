# Chapter Master - Adeptus Dominus

**Chapter Master** (aka CM) is a strategy/simulation game, written in **Game Maker Language**, originally designed and developed by Duke.\
This project aims to continue development on the game, fix any bugs, expand and add features.

**Adeptus Dominus** is just how the team of primordial collaborators decided to call themselves.
