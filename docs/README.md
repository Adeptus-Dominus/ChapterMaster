**Chapter Master** (aka CM) is a strategy/simulation game, written in **Game Maker Language**, originally designed and developed by Duke.\
This project aims to continue development on the game, fix any bugs, expand and add features.

**Adeptus Dominus** is just how the team of primordial collaborators decided to call themselves.

- Our discord server: [Chapter Master Discord](https://discord.gg/zAGpqHzsXQ)
  - Where most of the development talk, feature suggestion and bug-reporting takes place.
  - GitHub issues are not used at the moment, as such we use #bug-report-forum in this server to handle bug reports.
  - If you can code, draw, design, help with the GitHub stuff or just want to help in any way possible - you'll be welcomed with open arms.
  - If you just love WH40K and want to chat - you'll have a great time in the server as well.

- 1d6Chan Wiki: [Chapter Master: Adeptus Dominus](https://1d6chan.miraheze.org/wiki/Chapter_Master:_Adeptus_Dominus)
  - With some helpful pages that explain some of the new systems added in the Adeptus Dominus version.
  - Help with expanding it will be welcomed.

- Don't forget about the [GitHub Wiki (WIP)](https://github.com/Adeptus-Dominus/ChapterMaster/wiki)
  - Help with expanding this one will be welcomed as well.

- Main repository: [Adeptus-Dominus/ChapterMaster](https://github.com/Adeptus-Dominus/ChapterMaster)

## Playing
Just download the [latest release](https://github.com/Adeptus-Dominus/ChapterMaster/releases/latest) or a [development pre-release](https://github.com/Adeptus-Dominus/ChapterMaster/releases), unzip it and launch the .exe.

## Compiling

See [Compiling](https://github.com/Adeptus-Dominus/ChapterMaster/wiki/Compiling) wiki page or the [GameMaker tutorial](https://help.gamemaker.io/hc/en-us/articles/235186048-Setting-Up-For-Windows).

Creating packages (i.e., creating an .exe with the game) and exporting them is allowed by YoYo Games for non-commercial use.\
Everything else **must** be covered by [paid **GameMaker** subscriptions](https://gamemaker.io/en/get).
