# Chapter Master Documentation 

## How can I add new custom chapter icons?

Add them to the icons folder in the root of your game (ChapterMaster/icons/your_image.png).

Custom icons must be .png and 141x141 pixels or greater in size.
Note that MS Paint can save as .png files, but for some reason the encoding does not work.  You will have to use a different image editing program to save/create .png files for Chapter Master.

Non-square icons will be smooshed as needed when they are displayed.

Follow the name formatting shown below:

custom1.png
custom2.png
custom3.png
custom4.png
custom5.png
custom6.png
custom7.png
custom8.png
custom9.png
custom10.png
custom11.png
etc.
