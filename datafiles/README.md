# Chapter Master Documentation

## How can I add new custom chapter icons?

Custom icons must be .png and 141x141 pixels or greater in size.
Note that MS Paint can save as .png files, but for some reason the encoding does not work.  You will have to use a different image editing program to save/create .png files.

Non-square icons will be smooshed as needed when they are displayed.

Add them to the folder shown bellow, following the example name format:
`C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\ChapterMaster\Custom Files\Custom Icons\custom*.png` (replace * with a number from 1 to 99)

## Where are the save files stored?

`C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\ChapterMaster\`.

## Where are the error logs stored?

`C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\ChapterMaster\Logs`.

## Where are the message logs stored?

`C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\ChapterMaster\Logs\last_messages.log`.
