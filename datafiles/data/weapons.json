This esoteric weapon channels vast reserves of energy into a focused beam of coruscating light, tearing matter apart at the molecular level and converting it into raw energy in a cataclysmic chain reaction. The weapon’s lethality grows with distance — the further its target, the more apocalyptic the discharge. To stand at the far end of a Heavy Conversion Beamer’s wrath is to be annihilated in a searing blaze that leaves nothing but scorched ruin in its wake. Few battlefields have witnessed its fury and remained unchanged, for the weapon is as much a terror to its enemies as a reminder of the Imperium’s dwindling grasp on its most potent technologies.",
