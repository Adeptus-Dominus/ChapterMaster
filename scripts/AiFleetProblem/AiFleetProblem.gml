//All missions that run on a fleet need their own FleetProblem instance
//missions for the most part can only run from predefined points in the code
// to run from each of these points each mission must have a registered function these functions are then called implicitly
//each function follows the format  `__<p_id>_<entry_flag>`
/* the current entry points for the code are
    "per_turn" - runs every end turn to check for certain conditions often contains reactions to actions player has done last turn
        - runs via basic_turn_end

    "init" - runs immediately after problem is created often used to populate initial popup or stack popup for turn end

    "on_arrival" - runs when the fleet arrives at a star, fleet_event_data holds {star}
    "on_load" - runs when units are loaded onto the fleet, fleet_event_data holds {units}
    "on_unload" - runs when units are unloaded from the fleet, fleet_event_data holds {units}
    "on_split" - runs on the original fleet when it splits, fleet_event_data holds {new_fleet}
    "on_merge" - runs on the receiving fleet when another fleet merges into it, fleet_event_data holds {merged_fleet}
    "on_destruction" - runs when the fleet is destroyed, the mission is deleted after this function has run
        - must be triggered BEFORE the fleet instance is destroyed

    "mission_log_entry" - runs to provide a data row for the mission log

- other than these entry points and any other later defined positions mission specific code should not run outside of the FleetProblem container

- to set an entry point up simply register the function as a static e.g
    if i create static __example_per_turn once an "example" problem is registered on a fleet the per turn check will run
    no other code is required

other info
    - the owning fleet must have a `problems = []` array in its create event
    - entry points that receive extra information read it from fleet_event_data, which only exists for the duration of the call
    - set a mission for deletion by setting delete_mission = true; this will delete the mission after the current function
    has finished executing
    - functions prefixed with `__` are only accessible from within the FleetProblem's internal scope
